Tech Test for MadBox

## Controls
* W - Move Forward
* S - Move Backward
* Space - Toggle Post Process Effect

## Time to complete
* It took me around 3 hours to get the main loop code, the rest of the time I was fixing bugs as well as polishing.

## Parts that were difficult to me
* It's been a while since I developed a main game loop in Unity, normally I use it to test new features and tool development, so at first I felt a bit rusty but I rapidly got confident.

* It was also hard to focus on the main idea and don't lose too much time polishing things while the loop wasn't finished.

## Parts that I could do better
* Scene changing was the latest thing I implemented, and I didn't took a lot of time to think that trough, I'm not quite happy with how the code is structured.
* The collision detection is based on tags, which means long if statements checking for tags (not a problem for this simple game, but as the game grows that would become pretty messy), not the best solution I could come up with.
* I wanted to add my personal touch to the game so I implemented a GameBoy-like post process effect, I think that needs some improvement as well.

## What would I do if I could go a step further on this game
* I would add some sort of measure system, in order to measure how good you've done it (timer, number of deaths...).
* I would also add multiplayer(local at least) since the game has the potential for it, plus the original is a multiplayer game (though it works fine as single player).
* I would write a more generic code trying to use more design patterns. Since I had a limited time I made some asumptions in the code and some of it is just thought to work for this game.
* I would also add tons of levels! It's amazing how you can create infinite levels by just combining a several obstacles.
* I would also add some UI.
* Of course I would polish a lot the game, add character animations, models for the obstacles, ...

## What did I think
* I really enjoyed coming back to game development with Unity!
* I think the example game is a great choice that while being simple allows the developer to show off some of his skills.
* Event though I'm happy with the result I feel I can do way better (the time constraint got me a bit nervous here).
